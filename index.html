          Hey there! My name is Mary Frances, welcome to my website! A little
          about me: I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May
          of 2019 with a degree in Biology, and certificates in Marine and
          Environmental Science. I love nature and animals and pretty much
          anything outdoors. I spend a lot of time outside hiking, camping, and
          rock climbing with my friends and family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Post college, I was planning on pursuing a master's and eventually
          research in the field of marine biology. However, when I took my first
          computer science class my senior year of college, I had a quick (and
          quite terrifying) change in interests. I spent a lot of time
          researching the possibility of changing majors or even just taking on
          a certificate. However, due to my proximity to graduation, these
          options weren't exactly feasible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated with my biology degree and worked for a few months,
          teaching myself small coding snippets on the side. When I heard about
          the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp through my past computer science
          professor, I knew it was my oppurtunity to jump back in the subject. I
          am loving the bootcamp and the knowledge and experience I am gaining
          by developing complex applications. I am looking forward to pursuing a
          career in this field, with the end goal of finding an employer that
          allows me to merge my love of coding and science! Feel free to click
          around my site to view some of my projects! Thanks for visiting!
