            <p>My name is Mary Frances Skibiel. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May of 2019 with
                a degree in Biology, and certificates in Marine and Environmental Science. I love nature and animals and
                pretty much anything outdoors. I spend a lot of time outside hiking, camping, and rock climbing with my
                freinds and family. </p>

            <p>With my degree, I was planning on pursuing a higher education an eventually research in the field of
                marine biology. However, when I took my first computer science class my senior year of college, I had a
                quick (and quite terrifying) change in interests, and wanted more than anything to switch my major or
                take on a minor. Due to my proximity to graduation, these options weren't very feasible.</p>

            <p>So, I graduated with my biology degree and worked for a few months, teaching myself small coding snippets
                on the side. When I heard about the Georiga Tech Coding Bootcamp through my past CS professor, I knew it
                was my oppurtinity to jump back in the subject. So far I am loving the bootcamp and am looking forward
                to pursuing a career in this field. Feel free to click around my site to view some of my projects or
                contact me!! Thanks for visiting!</p>
